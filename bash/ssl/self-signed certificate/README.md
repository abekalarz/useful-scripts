# generate_keystore_and_signed_ssl_certificate.sh
Script useful when you need to create self-signed certificate for your HTTPS needs.

Script is fully independent and all what is needed to use this script is:
- openssl (I was using LibreSSL 2.6.4)
- keytool

Additionally script is fully configured via set of variables defined in the beginning of script.
